 The actual course contains following topics in this section:
 * History
 * Philosophy
 * Community
 * Terminology
 * Distribution
 I have just covered the last two parts here.

Terminologies:

Some terminologies related to linux are as below:

* Kernel                    --> Brain of the linux OS. Glue b/w hardware and applications 
* Distribution              --> Collection of softwares making up a linux based OS e.g Red Hat distro, Ubuntu, Fedora
* Boot Loader               --> Program that boots the Linux OS e.g GRUB & ISOLINUX
* Service                   --> Program that run as a background process e.g httpd, nfsd or ftpd e.t.c.
* File System               --> Method for storing and organizing files e.g ext3, ext4, FAT, NTFS or BtrFS
* X Windows System          --> This provides a standard toolkit for creating GUI on almost all linux systems
* Desktop Environment       --> GUI which is present on top of the OS e.g. GNOME, KDE, Xfce and Fluxbox
* Command Line              --> Interface for typing the command on top of the OS
* Shell                     --> Command line interpreter that interprets the command line input and instructs OS to perform certain tasks e.g bash or zsh e.t.c.        

Distribution:
---

* A Linux distribution is a complete operating system that consists of the Linux kernel plus additional software tools and applications.
* The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system, and a Linux distribution includes other tools for file operations, user management, and software package management.
* Each tool in a Linux distribution is often its own separate project, with its own developers working to perfect that piece of the system.
* Different Linux distributions may be based on different versions of the Linux kernel, and some distributions may incorporate improvements from newer kernels into their customized older versions.
* Other essential tools and ingredients provided by distributions include compilers, debuggers, system libraries, graphics interfaces, desktop environments, and installation and updating systems for various components, including the kernel itself.
* All distributions come with a complete suite of applications already installed.

* Organizations tend to choose commercially supported distributions e.g. from Red Hat, SUSE & Canonical (Ubuntu).
* CentOS and CentOS stream are free alternatives of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Small organizations who are comfortable without paid technical support tends to choose this distribution.
* Ubuntu and Fedora are popular in developers and educational community.
* All major distributors provide free update services for security and performance enhancements.
