# Practise Bash Scripts:

Here I have added all the bash scripts which I tried while learning from  [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/shell_scripting.htm).  
Follow below steps for writing a script:
1. Open any editor of your choice.
2. Add ***shebang*** line at start.
    > `#! /bin/sh` 
3. Befor running your script, do not forget to make it executable. You can do so by using:
    > `chmod +x file_name`
4. Run your script by using:
    > `./file_name`
