# Section 8: Vulnerability Scanning

I did not spend too much time in this section for preparation because vulnerability scanners are simple and easy to configure. In addition, the purpose of a vulnerability scanner is to identify security holes in services or in a operating system. These scanners rely on a database that contains the necessary information needed to conduct a scan. A word of caution! Be careful when you use vulnerability scanners on your targets because there is a chance that some of the plugins or features can cause an impact to your target such as taking down that service, locking out user accounts, and even crash the system.

The update replaces OpenVAS and students will learn how to use use Nessus. Nessus is more stable on Kali Linux and it has a simple straightforward interface. I also was able to use the Nessus Essential key for most of my testing and to help me get familiar with how these vulnerability scanners work. Nessus is a real popular tool for vulnerability scanning in the infosec world and I certainly encourage you to play with it!
